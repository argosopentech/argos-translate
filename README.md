# Argos Translate
[Docs](https://argos-translate.readthedocs.io) | [Website](https://www.argosopentech.com) | [Video intro](https://youtu.be/yn37-CpRzTc) | [GitHub](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) | [FSD](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Argos_Translate)

Open-source offline translation library written in Python. Uses [OpenNMT](https://opennmt.net/) for translations, [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) for tokenization, [Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) for sentence boundary detection, and [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) for GUI. Designed to be used as either a Python library, command-line, or GUI application. [LibreTranslate](https://libretranslate.com) is an API and web-app built on top of Argos Translate.

Argos Translate supports installing model files which are a zip archive with an ".argosmodel" extension that contains an OpenNMT [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2) model, a [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) tokenization model, a [Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) tokenizer model for sentence boundary detection, and metadata about the model. Pretrained models can be downloaded [here](https://www.argosopentech.com/argospm/index/).

Argos Translate also manages automatically pivoting through intermediate languages to translate between languages that don't have a direct translation between them installed. For example, if you have a es ➔ en and en ➔ fr translation installed you are able to translate from es ➔ fr as if you had that translation installed. This allows for translating between a wide variety of languages at the cost of some loss of translation quality.

## Installation
### Install from PyPI
Argos Translate is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/argostranslate/) and can be easily installed or updated with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -U argostranslate
```

### Install from Snap Store
Argos Translate is available from the Snap Store and auto installs a content snap to support translation between Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Additional languages can be installed from supplementary content snaps.

With [snapd installed](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd):
```
sudo snap install argos-translate
```
[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/argos-translate)

Automatically installs and connects to `argos-translate-base-langs` snap to support translations between Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.

Additional languages can be installed from *.argosmodel files or from supplementary content snaps:
* argos-translate-de-en - German - English
* argos-translate-en-it - English - Italian
* argos-translate-en-pt - English - Portuguese

To connect automatically:
`sudo snap connect argos-translate:argos-packages argos-translate-en-it:argos-packages`

To run command line interface on Snapcraft:
```
argos-translate.cli --help
```

### Installation for macOS

1. Download the latest [macOS release.](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate/releases/)
2. Extract the archive.
3. Copy the `.app` file to the Applications directory.

### Installation for Windows
CTranslate2, the inference engine for Argos Translate, [currently only distributes binaries for Linux and MacOS](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/issues/133) so to install Argos Translate on Windows you will need to build CTranslate2 from source.

### Python source installation
#### Dependencies
Requires Python3, pip (which should come with Python3), and optionally virtualenv to keep Argos Translate's dependencies separate from other Python programs you have installed.

[Python Installation Instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3
```

#### Install
1. Download a copy of this repo (this requires either installing git or downloading a zip from GitHub):
```
git clone https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate.git
cd argos-translate
```
2. Make a virtual environment to install into (optional):
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade virtualenv # If virtualenv not already installed
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
3. Install this package with pip:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install .
```

### GPU Acceleration

To enable GPU support, you need to set the `ARGOS_DEVICE_TYPE` env variable to `cuda` or `auto`.

```
$ ARGOS_DEVICE_TYPE=cuda argos-translate --from-lang en --to-lang es "Hello World"
Hola Mundo
```

The above env variable instructs [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2) to use cuda.
if you encounter any issues with GPU, please consider reading [CTranslate2 documentation](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2#what-hardware-is-supported).


### Build and install snap package
1. Install [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) if it isn't already installed.
2. Using snapd install snapcraft and its dependency multipass:
```
sudo snap install multipass
sudo snap install snapcraft
```
3. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate.git
cd argos-translate
```
4. From the root directory of this project build the snap package:
```
SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT_MEMORY=4G snapcraft
```
Any *unzipped* package files in package/ will be automatically included in the snap archive (and won't be able to be deleted by users of the snap).

Note, the build won't run with Snapcraft's default build memory of 2GB so you need to set the SNAPCRAFT_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT environment variable. [More on Snapcraft forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcraft-configuration-of-multipass-vm-arguments/9761).

5. Install the snap package:
```
sudo snap install --devmode argos-translate_<version information>.snap
```

### Run Argos Translate!

#### GUI
Run the GUI version of Argos Translate.

```
argos-translate-gui
```

When installing with snap a .desktop file should also be installed which will make Argos Translate available from the desktop menu.

Languages are chosen as drop down choices. More languages pairs can be installed.

The left text box translates into the right box.

Example workflow translating from Vietnamese into English:

1. Set the left drop down to `Vietnamese` and the right drop down to `English`.
1. Replace the default text `Text to translate from` in the left text box with some text in Vietnamese. A quick way to do this is to click in the left text box and press the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+a` to select all and then `CTRL+v` to paste.
1. Wait patiently.
1. When text appears in the right text box, read the translation!

If the output looks similar to the input, try changing the origin language as some languages appear similar if you are unfamiliar with them.

### [Command Line](https://argos-translate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/cli.html)

Run the command line version of Argos Translate.
```
argos-translate
```

Translate a string from English to Spanish.

Note: If you do not have the language pair that you are calling installed, you will get a `Traceback` error.

```
argos-translate --from-lang en --to-lang es "Hello World."
Hola Mundo
```

Translate longer text piped into `argos-translate`.

```
echo "Text to translate" | argos-translate --from-lang en --to-lang es
Texto para traducir
```

## Adding language pair models

Language pairs are on average 100MB each.
